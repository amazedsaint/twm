# Experiment Learnings

The new examples push the same pattern across robotics, molecular dynamics, and
materials:

```text
proposal is useful for search -> transaction owns physical validity -> receipt teaches the next proposal
```

## What Improved

- Robotics showed that a high soft score for a short path must not outrank a
  signed-distance safety violation. Residuals can repair the path while commit
  authority stays with the hard verifier.
- Molecular dynamics showed that the candidate must bind the integrator, not
  just a plausible next state. The verifier rejects Euler when the contract is a
  velocity-Verlet step, then commits the repaired state with bounded energy and
  momentum drift.
- Material lattice dynamics showed that proposal randomness belongs in the
  receipt. A Metropolis accept/reject decision is auditable only when the
  Hamiltonian delta, beta, uniform sample, and post-flip lattice are bound.

## Substrate Direction

The frontier is a programmable transactional world model where each scientific
domain contributes:

- a typed state and candidate schema,
- a hard verifier that owns the domain law,
- a replay/rollback adapter,
- residuals that are specific enough to repair proposals,
- manifests or replay packages that bind evidence before claim promotion.

The current examples suggest the next hardening step: promote a shared example
report/certificate shape so every domain can publish the same fields for
receipt hashes, verifier identity, replay status, rollback status, residual
kinds, and claim boundary.
